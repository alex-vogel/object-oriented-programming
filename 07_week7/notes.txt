Remember:
Header file contains class definition and prototypes (.hpp file)

Source file contains the implementation of the methods in the class (.cpp file)



Instance and static members:

An instance variable is tied to a specific instance of the class; its not shraed among objects of the same class

A static variable (Class variable) is shared by all objects of the class. Static variables store values in common memory locations.

A static function cannot access instance memebers of te class

ex:
    static int numberOfObjects;
    static in getNumberOfOBjects();


Static variables and functions can be accessed without creating objects

Instance functions can only be called from a specific instance

Use ClassName::functionName(arguments) to invoke a static function and ClassName::staticVariable to access static variables


A variable or unction thats dependent on a specific instance of the class should be an instance vaiable or function. A variable or
function that isnt dependent on a specific instance


EX:

class Math{
    public:
    static int square(int n);
    static int add(int n1, int n2);
};

and now you can call
std::cout <<Math::square(5) << '\n';
in your main without calling an object.
