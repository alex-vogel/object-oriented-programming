C++ allows you to define functions for operators. This is called operator overloading.

Operator overloading
    -The operators are funcitons defined in a class. These functions are named with keyword operator followed by actual operator
    -Most of the operators in C++ can be defined as fuinctions to perform desireable operator
    - data type ClassName::operator OperatorName
    (const ClassName &ParameterName)


    -You cannot create new operator; only existing operators can be overloaded.

    There are few which CANT be overloaded
    ?:    .   .*   ::

    C++ defines the oeprator precedence and associativity. YOu cannot change the operator precedence and associatvitiy by overloading.
    if you overload * and +, the * will still be first.


    Most operators are bianary operators. Some are unary, You cannot change the number of operands by overloading. For example the divide /
    operator is bianary.



    bool ClassName::operator<(const CLassName&);



    Bianary operator: two inputs returns bool

    Arithmetic operators: Return a completely new thing by using two inputs




    return by reference:
    int& operator[](int index);   we return by reference because if we dont, we simpily return a copy and if any changes are made they
                                   wont be made to the actual object, just its copy


Lvalue referes to anything that appears on the left side of the operator
