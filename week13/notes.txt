Dynamic casting

-Safe downcasting in inheritance hierarchies
-Uses dynamic_cast<T*>(ptr) or dynamic_cast<T&>(ref)
-Requires polymorphic class











-----------intro to throwing

If you have a program which just divides 2 numbers it works perfectly till denominator is set to 0. You could create an if statement
but what if the fuction needs to return an integer?

How could we differentiate a return of 0 from numerator being 0 or denominator being 0?

We need to show the function that something bad has happened, we throw an exception.

    -You can throw any data type or class object you want, so long as somewhere the exception is caught somewhere



Exception handling:
-Enables a function to throw an exception to its caller
-Often, the called function does not know what to do in case of error
- The fundamental idea of exception handling is to seperate error detection (done in a called function) from error handling (done in calling)

- Exception handling enablesa  program to deal with exceptional situations and continue its normal execution

try{
    code to try;
    throw an exception with a throw statement
}
catch(type ex){
    code to process exception;
}


throw -> sends an error
try -> watches code
catch -> fixes
