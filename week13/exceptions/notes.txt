Exception classes:


Hierarchy of exceptions

exceptions live in <stdexcept> header

but you can also create your own exception class.
    This is just like any C++ class, but often it is desireable to derive it from exception or derived class of exception so that you
    can utilize the common operators (e.g. the what() function)
    #include <stdexcept>




Exception Propagation:
    -An exception is thrown through a chain of calling functions until it is caught, or it reaches the main function.
        
        -When an exception occurs in a chain of functions, the exception will disrupt the program, going through the chain till its
        resolved.
