dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during execution time or run time.

*In languages like C and C++, heap allocation allows for manual memory management, giving the programmer control over
when memory is allocated and deallocated. This can be both an advantage and a responsibility as it requires careful management to avoid
memory leaks and other issues.

* In languages like Javam C#, and python, the heap is managed by a garbage collector, which automatically deallocates memory when
its no longer needed.


To free memory use the delete operator.
to delete variable p -> delete p;
to delete array x -> delete [] x;

to create a double
double* pD - new double;

to access pD?
*pD;

to delete it?
delete pD;




Advantages:
*When we do not know how much memory would be needed for the program beforehand (size is determined at runtime, oppsed to compile time)
*Objects in heap have a dynamic lifetime, they can exist beyond the scope of the function or method that created them.
*Enables handling of large data sets that may exceed stack memory limits, as dynamic memory is allocated on the heap.
*Complex data structures like linked lists, trees, ect..


To create dynamic object:
ClassName* pObject = new ClassName();



example:
class Building{
    int n_floors
}
int main(){
    Building* pBuilding1 = new Building();
    std::cout >> pBuilding1 -> n_floors;
    ## or do this:
    std::cout >> (*pBuilding1).n_floors;
}



To create a string dynamically:

std::string* p = new std::string;

(*p).length();
## or
p -> size();


to delete something in the heap simpily do delete


Custom copy constructor
ex:
Course::Course(const Course& course){
    courseName = course.name;
    numOfStudents = course.numOfStudents;
    capacity = course.capacity;
    students = new string[capacity];
}


the "this" pointer

-The this pointer points to the calling object itself.
-Sometimes you need to reference the hidden data field name in the function in order to set a new value to it
-A hidden data field can be accessed using the this keyword

ex a function that takes int age which your supposed to set variable age equal to
this->age = age;
