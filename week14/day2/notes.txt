you can open a file in many modes

ios::in, ios::out, ....

you can write/read data into a filw using bianary, ios::bianary



often you need to write data other than characters/
in C++ use reinterpret_cast

reinterpret_cast<dataType>(address) //NOTE: you cant use a pointer here, the object itself must be sent



DO NOT USE BINARY with pointers, strings, vectors, or virtual functions
