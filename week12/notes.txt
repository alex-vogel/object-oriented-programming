REmember: Protected things are somewhere between public and private data. They are accessible by the class itself, and child classes



There are also different types of inheritance
public: Everything stays the same
protected: Public will become protected
private: Everything becomes private.



Polymorphism: variable, function, or objects can take on multiple forms.

-Every instance (object) of a derived class is also an instance of (object of) its base class.
-Class objects belonging to the same hierarchical tree (inherited from a common parent class)
    may have functions with the same name, but with different behaviors
- This polymorphism means that a variable of a supertype can refer to a subtype object
- Polymorphism achieved via pointers/reference + virtual functions




Virtual functions:
A function can be implememented in several clases along the inheritance chain. Virtual functions enable the system to decide
which function is invoked at runtime based on the actual type of object.





if you know a function will be redefined in other classes, you should make it a virtual function. If a function wont be redefined, dont.
We call a class with a virtual function a polymorphic type.



if you know that someone will inherit from this class, you should define methods as virtual.



Abstract class: A class with one pure virtual function (undefined function that is based on the objects that call it)
